## DESCRIPTION:

Sentiment Analysis is a powerful Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique used to determine the emotional tone behind a body of text. It is widely used in business and research to understand customer opinions, feedback, and general sentiment. This project focuses on building a sentiment classification model that classifies customer reviews as positive or negative.

In this internship task, we aim to perform sentiment analysis using **TF-IDF vectorization** and **Logistic Regression**. The goal is to preprocess a dataset of customer reviews, convert the text into a format suitable for machine learning, train a classifier, and evaluate its performance using common metrics.

TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) is a widely used text representation technique that emphasizes important words in a document while reducing the impact of commonly occurring words. Logistic Regression, a linear model, is then used to classify the sentiment based on the extracted features.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset:

We use a dataset consisting of customer reviews labeled with sentiment (positive or negative). The dataset is preprocessed to clean and prepare the text for modeling.

---

## âœ… Implementation Steps:

1. **Import Required Libraries**: Including pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, and NLTK for text processing.
2. **Load and Explore Dataset**: Understand structure, distribution, and sentiment balance.
3. **Text Preprocessing**: Includes cleaning text (lowercasing, removing punctuation, stopwords removal, tokenization).
4. **Feature Extraction**: Apply TF-IDF vectorization to convert text into numerical format.
5. **Model Training**: Train a Logistic Regression classifier on the transformed data.
6. **Prediction & Evaluation**: Evaluate using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
7. **Visualization**: Visualize evaluation metrics and word importance if applicable.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective:

- Understand and apply text preprocessing techniques.
- Learn how to represent text data using TF-IDF.
- Implement a machine learning pipeline for text classification.
- Evaluate model performance and interpret results.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Conclusion:

Through this task, we gain practical experience in natural language processing, data cleaning, and model training. This project demonstrates how simple yet effective techniques like TF-IDF and Logistic Regression can yield powerful insights from textual data. By the end of this notebook, we have a complete NLP pipeline capable of classifying sentiments, showcasing our ability to handle real-world unstructured data.

This internship project has enriched our knowledge of NLP, and the techniques learned here are applicable to various domains such as social media monitoring, product review analysis, and customer feedback systems.
